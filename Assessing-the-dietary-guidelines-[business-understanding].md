**This is a summary of aims that based on the [five guidelines](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/executive-summary/#the-guidelines)** 

-----
|Guideline|Task|
|:----|:----|
|1. Follow healthy eating patterns across lifespan| Promote a consistent, efficient daily routine.|  
|2. Focus on variety, density, amount of nutrients| Encourage exploration of the abundance of variety in food.|
|3. Limit sugar calories, saturated fats, sodium| Make sure the numbers add up to a healthy pattern.|
|4. Shift towards nutrient-dense choices in all food groups| Enable informed choices to prefer nutrient density over empty calories.|
|5. Support healthy living for all| Foster community.|

Considering the points above, a salient objective is to foster a culture of health through home-cooked meals: establish efficient, economical, pleasurable home-cooking as the main source of food intake.  Rather than focus on deprivation as a way to health, make use of the abundance of the variety of food: consider the possibility that for every unhealthy craving or choice, there are a number of healthy solutions that fully satisfy the need.  

The data science solution would be a recipe recommender system that satisfies user taste preferences and nutritional requirements while capitalizing on the resources available.
