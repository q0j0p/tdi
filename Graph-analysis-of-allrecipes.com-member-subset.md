This is the graph of the member network in its entirety:

Using Gephi's "Force Atlas" layout and adjusting the gravity and repulsion settings, a "ring of saturn" effect can distribute networks by size, the smaller ones going to the periphery.  

Selecting the biggest connected component and differentiating the nodes according to modularity (Louvain method) yields this 
[graph](https://github.com/q0j0p/food/blob/master/notes/resources/modularity.pdf).

Do people with similar dietary habits cluster together?  The next graph illustrates the median fat content of recipes made and "favorited" by each user, depicted by size of node.

Visual EDA is iffy.
